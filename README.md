# Customer Churn Prediction

## Problem Statement
In today's competitive business landscape, customer retention is paramount for sustainable growth and success. Our challenge is to develop a predictive model that can identify customers who are at risk of churning...

## Data Description
The dataset consists of customer information for a churn prediction problem. It includes the following columns:

- **CustomerID**: Unique identifier for each customer.  
- **Name**: Name of the customer.  
- **Age**: Age of the customer.  
- **Gender**: Gender of the customer (Male or Female).  
- **Location**: Location where the customer is based, with options including Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, Chicago, and New York.  
- **Subscription_Length_Months**: The number of months the customer has been subscribed.  
- **Monthly_Bill**: Monthly bill amount for the customer.  
- **Total_Usage_GB**: Total usage in gigabytes.  
- **Churn**: A binary indicator (1 or 0) representing whether the customer has churned (1) or not (0).  

## Technologies Used
### **Programming Language**
- **Python**: Used for data analysis, modeling, and implementation of machine learning algorithms.

### **Libraries and Tools**
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis  
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing and array operations  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive coding and documentation  
- **Scikit-Learn**: Machine learning library  
- **Random Forest Classifier**: Ensemble learning model  

## Machine Learning Models Used
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Tree**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Naive Bayes**
- **AdaBoost**
- **Gradient Boosting**
- **XGBoost**
- **Neural Networks (TensorFlow & Keras)**

## Model Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy**
- **Precision, Recall, and F1-score**
- **Confusion Matrix**
- **ROC Curve and AUC (Area Under Curve)**

## Data Processing Techniques
- **StandardScaler**: Standardizes features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.  
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Dimensionality reduction for feature selection.  
- **GridSearchCV**: Hyperparameter tuning for optimal model performance.  
- **Cross-Validation**: Evaluates generalization performance of models.  
- **Early Stopping & ModelCheckpoint**: Prevents overfitting and saves the best model.  

## Outcome
The outcome of this customer churn prediction project involves developing a machine learning model to predict whether customers are likely to churn or not. This prediction is based on various customer attributes such as age, gender, location, subscription length, monthly bill, and total usage. The model's primary purpose is to assist in identifying customers who are at a higher risk of churning, enabling the business to take proactive measures to retain them. By using the trained model to predict churn, the company can allocate resources more effectively, personalize engagement strategies, and implement targeted retention efforts. Ultimately, the project's success is measured by the model's ability to make predictions, helping the company reduce churn rates, improve customer satisfaction, and optimize its customer retention strategies.
