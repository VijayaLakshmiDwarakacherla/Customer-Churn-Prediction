Customer Churn Prediction
Problem Statement:
In today's competitive business landscape, customer retention is paramount for sustainable growth and success. Our challenge is to develop a predictive model that can identify customers who are at risk of churning – discontinuing their use of our service. Customer churn can lead to a significant loss of revenue and a decline in market share. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to build a model that can accurately predict whether a customer is likely to churn based on their historical usage behavior, demographic information, and subscription details. This predictive model will allow us to proactively target high-risk customers with personalized retention strategies, ultimately helping us enhance customer satisfaction, reduce churn rates, and optimize our business strategies. The goal is to create an effective solution that contributes to the long-term success of our company by fostering customer loyalty and engagement.
Data Description
The dataset consists of customer information for a churn prediction problem. It includes the following columns:
•	CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer.
•	Name: Name of the customer.
•	Age: Age of the customer.
•	Gender: Gender of the customer (Male or Female).
•	Location: Location where the customer is based, with options including Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, Chicago, and New York.
•	Subscription_Length_Months: The number of months the customer has been subscribed.
•	Monthly_Bill: Monthly bill amount for the customer.
•	Total_Usage_GB: Total usage in gigabytes.
•	Churn: A binary indicator (1 or 0) representing whether the customer has churned (1) or not (0).

Outcome:
The outcome of this customer churn prediction project involves developing a machine learning model to predict whether customers are likely to churn or not. This prediction is based on various customer attributes such as age, gender, location, subscription length, monthly bill, and total usage. The model's primary purpose is to assist in identifying customers who are at a higher risk of churning, enabling the business to take proactive measures to retain them. By using the trained model to predict churn, the company can allocate resources more effectively, personalize engagement strategies, and implement targeted retention efforts. Ultimately, the project's success is measured by the model's ability to make predictions, helping the company reduce churn rates, improve customer satisfaction, and optimize its customer retention strategies.
